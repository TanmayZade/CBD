## Overview
The CBD Project is a Python-based application designed to utilize machine learning models, specifically the cb_sgd_final.sav file, for predictive analysis. This project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly interface for users to interact with the models, with the help of the app.py file. The project structure is well-organized, making it easy for new users to navigate and contribute.

## ✨ Key Features
* 📈 Utilizes a trained machine learning model (cb_sgd_final.sav) for predictive analysis
* 📊 Employs a vectorizer (vectorizer.pkl) for data preprocessing
* 🌐 Provides a web interface (templates folder) for user interaction
* 📝 Includes a Procfile for easy deployment
* 📁 Organized project structure with separate files for requirements (requirements.txt) and runtime (runtime.txt)

## 🚀 Tech Stack
* Python: Used as the primary programming language for the project
* Python dependencies: Utilized for various tasks such as data preprocessing, model training, and web development
* Machine learning libraries: Used for training and utilizing the cb_sgd_final.sav model
